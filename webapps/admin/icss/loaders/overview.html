		<p>SmartAdmin comes with a fully customized grid system catered specifically for building form layouts. Its not technically "better" than the bootstrap 3 built in grid system, 
			but rather more simplified for rapid form layout and faster development. Idealy you would use either the <strong>bootstrap</strong> grid or the <strong>smart-form</strong> grid, 
			when building your form layouts. It is important not to mix elements from two seperate classes as it can cause conflict.  
		</p>
		
		<p>You can explore some of the <a href="#ajax/form-templates.html" title="Go to Bootstrap Forms">layouts</a> made using Smart Forms grid system or if you are not comfortable with this grid system you can simply stick to the default <a href="#ajax/bootstrap-forms.html" title="Go to Bootstrap Forms">Bootstrap forms</a></p>
